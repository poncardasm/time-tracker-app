# Create Changelog

## 1. Changelog File Creation

1. Create a new markdown `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md` file in the `docs/changelog/` directory.
2. Use the Europe/Helsinki timezone for time stamping.
3. Name the file using the current date and time in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md`

## 2. Changelog Content

1. In the newly created file, include a concise summary of the latest updates or changes made to the project since the last changelog entry.
2. Use clear section headings where appropriate (e.g., Added, Fixed, Changed, Removed).
3. Ensure the content is human-readable and formatted in valid Markdown.
